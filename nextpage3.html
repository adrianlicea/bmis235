        <b><b>General Running Advice:</b></b>
        My advice to those who genuinely want to start running is to start running where ever you can little by little. As soon as simply just start going for runs, even if you start small like jogging, it makes all the difference. Then, sooner than you know it, you'll be getting that runner's high and you won't want to quit! Have a great time running and enjoy those trails!

        <b>Gear Advice:</b>
        For those who don't know what gear to get, and by gear I mean running shoes, I highly recommend any running pair from Nike for I feel they make the best overall running shoe. Below I've attached a link to the Nike website and to a pair of Nike running shoes I recommend for those who don't know where to start. Hope you enjoy!
